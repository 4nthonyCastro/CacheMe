	Instructions for Project
================================================
-	You'll need to have Python installed. 
	It's expected to run just fine within UTSA's fox servers (yet to be tested). 
	Don't forget to give the correct permissions to Sim.py

-	Command to Run 'Sim.py':
	Sim.py -f Trace1.trc -s 1024 -b 16 -a 2 -r RR

- 	The goal here is to play with the parameters and you'll see the numbers change.
